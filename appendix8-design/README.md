# Introduction
Desing matters because of the need for change software (add
funcionality, solve bugs,..). So we must want our application to be easy
to change.

In OO, we use to use object to interact using messages. So this object
have dependencies.

The desing has two component: write the code for the feature and create
code that is amenable to being changed.

### Desing Principles
SOLID:
  - Single Responsibility
  - Open-Closed
  - Liskov Substitution
  - Interface Segregation
  - Dependency Inversion

# Designing Classes
Code must be TRUE (TRANSPARENT, REASONABLE, USABLE, EXEMPLARY)
